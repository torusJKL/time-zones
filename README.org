* Time Zones

A lovely major mode to view city times across the world.

Launch =time-zones= with:

** Toggle help

[[file:toggle-help.gif]]

** Toggle details (UTC offset + DST)

[[file:toogle-details.gif]]

** Add a city

[[file:add-city.gif]]

** OS supported

- macOS
- GNU/Linux
- Windows

* Install

** From MELPA

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :lexical no
  (use-package time-zones
    :ensure t)
#+end_src

** From source

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :lexical no
  (use-package time-zones
    :vc (:url "https://github.com/xenodium/time-zones"))
#+end_src

** Customization

The default sort order is chronologically ascending, so time zones in "the past" occur earlier in the list than time zones in "the future". You can select chronologically descending sorting via:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :lexical no
  (setq time-zones-sorting-function 'time-zones-sort-descending)
#+end_src

* Run

#+begin_src
  M-x time-zones
#+end_src

Press =+= to add a city.

* Data Sources

This package would not be possible without these data sources:

- Countries, states, and cities database: [[https://github.com/dr5hn/countries-states-cities-database]]
- POSIX TZ database for Windows timezone support: [[https://github.com/nayarsystems/posix_tz_db]]
